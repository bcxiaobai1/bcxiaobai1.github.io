Below, I will write down the core knowledge points, such as how to build a prompt and how the prompt looks like in each application. Therefore, this blog contains more notes than tutorials.

You should express what you want a model to do by  
providing instructions that are as clear and  
specific as you can possibly make them.  
This will guide the model towards the desired output,  
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant  
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a  
clear prompt with writing a short prompt.  
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity  
and context for the model, which can lead to  
more detailed and relevant outputs.

Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some  
water boiling. While that's happening,  
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is  
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag.  
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a

My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush,

pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and 
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to 
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and 
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last 
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head 
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than 
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different 
length bristles to get between teeth better because 
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one 
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's 
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can 
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal 
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about 
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) 
around the second week of December the prices all went 
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same 
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or 
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. 
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part 
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good 
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I 
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush 
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the  
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size 
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping 
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade 
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade 
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making 
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and 
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the  
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making 
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor)  
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so 
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. 
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. 
I called customer service but the warranty expired 
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall 
quality has gone done in these types of products, so 
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and 
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about 
two days.

In a recent survey conducted by the government, 
public sector employees were asked to rate their level 
of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the 
Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and 
work towards improving job satisfaction across all departments.

Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking

it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the 
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was 
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it

the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal 
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about 
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) 
around the second week of December the prices all went 
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same 
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or 
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. 
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part 
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good 
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I 
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush 
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the  
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size 
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping 
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade 
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade 
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making 
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and 
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the  
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making 
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor)  
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so 
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. 
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. 
I called customer service but the warranty expired 
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall 
quality has gone done in these types of products, so 
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and 
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about 
two days.
